# B4-BINGO-Number-Generator
an Apple WatchÂ® BINGO number generator app with histogram and history.

This is a basic app using the Apple Watch which displays random BINGO numbers by tapping the watch face. Up to 75 random numbers are generated and can be started over by pressing New Game and Confirm New Game.  When the next number is tapped, there is a one second delay (debounce) which prevents the accidental generation of multiple numbers when double or triple tapped.
In the future, I will code a histogram and display a history of numbers generated.
